# Browser-startup-page

My cool startup page for my browsers that I made.

A HTML page that will be show when I startup my browser that looks better then the defualt one.

## How to use it?

When downloaded you can go into your browser settings and change the startup page.

- <b>On Chrome:</b> go to your chrome 'On Startup' settings `chrome://settings/onStartup` and select 'Open a specific page or set of pages' and change the url to the file location of the index.html.
- <b>On Firefox:</b> go to your firefox 'New Windows and Tabs' settings `about:preferences#home` and for the 'Homepage and new windows' select 'Costum URLs...' and change the url to the file location of the index.html.
